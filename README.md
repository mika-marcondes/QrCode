## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

The project was a lot of fun to work on. I was able to recall things from when I first started learning HTML and CSS. At first, I had a little trouble to understand how flex worked, and picking up CSS. But as I did the challenge things started to clear out for me. For my first challenge, I'm very happy with the final result. ðŸ˜„

Special thanks to my girlfriend, and my cats.
